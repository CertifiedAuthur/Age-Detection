# Age Prediction from Images

This project focuses on predicting the age of a person depicted in an image. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch to classify images into different age groups. The accuracy achieved by the model is 0.33, which could be improved with a larger and more diverse dataset.

## Technology Stack
1. Python
2. PyTorch
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
4. CV Studio

CV Studio is used for dataset management, model training, and evaluation. The dataset consists of images labeled with the corresponding age groups of the individuals. The CNN model, implemented using PyTorch, is trained on this dataset to learn age-related features from the images.
